SimpleStorage Solidity Project
Welcome to my first Solidity project - SimpleStorage! This repository contains a basic Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the use of data types, functions, and arrays. It's a great starting point for me who is just getting acquainted with Remix and Solidity.

Project Overview
Solidity Concepts Covered
Data Types: The contract uses various data types, such as uint, to store and manage data.

Functions: Explore the functionality of functions in Solidity. The contract includes a simple function to update the stored data.

Arrays: how to use arrays in Solidity for more complex data structures. The contract showcases a basic array operation.
